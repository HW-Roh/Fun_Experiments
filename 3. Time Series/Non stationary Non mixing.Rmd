## Example of Non-stationary and Non-mixing

Suppose we flip a fair coin. If head, the stochastic process traces out the sin curve. If tail, the stochastic process traces out the cos curve.

$$Y(t)=\cos \left(t - X\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}\right) $$
where $P(X=0)=0.5$ and $P(X=1)=0.5$ 

```{r}
x = rbinom(n = 10000, 1, 0.5)
mean(x)

for (i in length(x)){
  
}
```
